# Directus Desktop App - WIP

The **Directus Desktop App** is an Electron-based application designed to bring Directus management to your desktop environment. It simplifies your workflow by allowing direct interaction with your Directus instance without needing a web browser. This project is currently a **work in progress (WIP)** and is under active development.

## Features (Planned & In Development)

- **Directus Integration**: Access and manage Directus CMS with a native desktop interface.
- **S3-Compatible File Uploads**: Upload files directly to DigitalOcean Spaces (S3 compatible) from the app.
- **File Registration**: Automatically register uploaded files into the Directus CMS.
- **Secure Token Management**: Store Directus access tokens locally using `electron-store` for enhanced security.
- **Help Menu Versioning**: Dynamically display the app version retrieved from an external configuration file.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Currently targeting Windows, with plans for macOS and Linux.

Stay tuned for further updates as this app progresses. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
